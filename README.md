# TrackingCalculator
This is a calculator designed to track users based on their calculator usage and to serve them ads based on those usages. Originally created as the final project for one of my development classes.

ToDo:

-Change the implementation for storage from a database to a file. This original implementation was solely to fulfill the requirements of the project, but the file-based implementation would be superior for most other cases.

-Clean up clunkier parts of the code

-Add actual documentation
